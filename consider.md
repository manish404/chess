## Things to consider

1. reducing loops
2. reducing html & JS communication
    - store elements somewhere in JS (if required later)
3. convert specific idea or code to a function; for later use
4. Everything Object Oriented
5. clean variable after using (if not needed later)
6. run function only if necessary 
    - like generating new possible moves only if piece's position is changed.
7. create function for all css affects while playing
    - or, write css code and give class/id to element
8. Use whole numbers instead of using row & column
    - addition, subtraction, & multiplication will give us desired result
9. remove uncessary checkings/conditions
    - like checking name/color of pieces while playing 
    - just store it somewhere
10. don't run a function two times in a class
    - store result until result is going to be changed
11. make something that keep tracks of everything
    - and all files could access it easily
12. try to convert resused code into function (like in functions.js)
13. store everything in variable
    - if used single time, do hard coded
14. write report about 
    - how something is implemented?
    - why this is done instead of another way?
    - problems and fixes
